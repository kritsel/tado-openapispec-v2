    Community managed API definition for the tado API hosted on https://my.tado.com/api/v2/. 
    This definition is not officially supported or published by tado&ordm;.
    
    Start with `[user] GET /me`. This will give you the id of your home and you can take it further from there.
    
    ## tado&ordm; X support
    
    This API is primarily meant to support homes equipped with tado&ordm; V3 (and earlier generation) devices.
    It provides limited support for tado&ordm; X enabled homes.
    
    API operation groups (and sometimes individual API operations) are labelled to indicate whether they support tado&ordm; X or not:
    
    | group label            | operation label | explanation                               |
    |------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------| 
    | **[ &check; tado X]**  | [ + tado X]     |  operation group (or single operation) supports tado&ordm; X |
    | **[ &cross; tado X]**  | [ NO tado X]    |  operation group (or single operation) does not support tado&ordm; X |     
    | **[ ~ tado X]**        |                 |  some operations do supports tado&ordm; X, others don't |      
    
    Note: when a group is labelled with **[ ~ tado X]**, 
    individual operations in that group are labelled as [ + tado X] or [ NO tado X]

        From [https://support.tado.com/en/articles/4467468-what-is-care-protect](https://support.tado.com/en/articles/4467468-what-is-care-protect):
              
        If you have an Auto-Assist subscription, or if Incident Detection is included in your tado° starter kit, 
        then tado° will constantly monitor your heating system to let you know if something isn’t working properly.
        It considers various factors, including the indoor temperature of each room, your Smart Schedule and open windows.

        If there are any unexpected changes, you’ll receive a notification and be given the option 
        to try to identify and resolve the issue or call in a professional to do so for you. 
        This means you can address boiler problems as they arise, and in some cases even avoid costly repairs. 

        Incident Detection works with all boiler types and interfaces, however it might not detect every incident. 
        For instance, the tado° app won’t show bus interface errors of digitally connected boilers (e.g. regarding a broken pump).

      description: >
        For each zone you can define three different timetables, where each timetable is identified by a timetable type: 
        
        * ONE_DAY (the same schedule for every day of the week),
        
        * THREE_DAY (the same schedule for weekdays, and a separate schedule for saturday and sunday) and
        
        * SEVEN_DAY (a different schedule for each day of the week).
        
        
        Only one of these timetables can be active at any one time 
        (see `/homes/{homeId}/zones/{zoneId}/schedule/activeTimetable`).
        
        
        Each timetable for a timetable type consists of an array of blocks.
        Each block consists of a day type (e.g. MONDAY_TO_FRIDAY for the THREE_DAY timetable type), a start time and end time 
        and the setting (e.g. temperature) for that time period.

      # the double empty lines below are intentional, they control the layout in Swagger UI.
      description: >
        For each zone you can define three different timetables, where each timetable is identified by a timetable type: 

        * ONE_DAY (the same schedule for every day of the week),

        * THREE_DAY (the same schedule for weekdays, and a separate schedule for saturday and sunday) and

        * SEVEN_DAY (a different schedule for each day of the week).


        Only one of these timetables can be active at any one time 
        (see `/homes/{homeId}/zones/{zoneId}/schedule/activeTimetable`).


        Each timetable for a timetable type consists of an array of blocks.
        Each block consists of a day type (e.g. MONDAY_TO_FRIDAY for the THREE_DAY timetable type), a start time and end time 
        and the setting (e.g. temperature) for that time period.

        In the tado documentation a heating circuit is called a 'heating zone'. 
        It is defined as 
        "A Heating Zone refers to the piping system that carries hot water from the boiler to your rooms, 
         and back to the boiler."
        
        A 'heating zone' is not to be confused with a 'zone'; a 'zone' represents a single room 
        which is serviced by a 'heating zone'

        Value descriptions:

        * MANUAL: the (temperature) settings in the ZoneOverlay will last indefinitely

        * TIMER: the (temperature) settings in the ZoneOverlay will last for a fixed number of seconds, 
        starting at the moment the ZoneOverlay was set (requires setting durationInSeconds as well)

        * TADO_MODE: the (temperature) settings in the ZoneOverlay will last until the next

        When setting a ZoneOverlay this value is used to specify until when the ZoneOverlay should be active.


        Compared to ZoneOverlayTerminationType it contains NEXT_TIME_BLOCK as an extra value.


        Value descriptions:

        * MANUAL: the (temperature) settings in the ZoneOverlay will last indefinitely

        * TIMER: the (temperature) settings in the ZoneOverlay will last for a fixed number of seconds, 
        starting at the moment the ZoneOverlay was set (requires setting durationInSeconds as well)

        NEXT_TIME_BLOCK could be a deprecated value. The app features which allow a user to set an ZoneOverlay
        (or a DefaultZoneOverlay) only offer options that translate into MANUAL, TIMER or TADO_MODE.
